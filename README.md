# RiffRadar
Project for COM S 309 at Iowa State

Riff Radar is an Android app built to organize local music scenes. By allowing venues of any size to create accounts, the barrier to hosting a concert is removed. Attendees, Bands, and Venues can all work together to make concerts happen. 

This app was developed by Kaden Berger, Sullivan Hart, Pranava Sai Maganti, and Peter Yehl.
